# Simple telegram shell bot

This bot lets you receive messages and handle them as shell commands, then, redirect the output to the sender's private chat.

## Dependencies

- GNU minimal toolkit (curl).

## Usage

Edit `run.sh` so that the `api_key` and `allowed_chat_ids` are defined based on your needs.

Once you're done with that, just run it.
